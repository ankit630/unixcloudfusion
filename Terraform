1. Installing the Terraform on the Amazon linux
https://www.terraform.io/downloads

sudo yum install -y yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo
sudo yum -y install terraform



2. If you want to run the terraform from visual studio code install the plugin of the terraform in the VSCode. And to run it make sure you save the file as 
filename.tf basically .tf extensions tells its a terraform file and you can run it from VScode


3. Creating a Ec2 instance using the terraform

provider "aws" {
    region = "us-east-1"
    access_key = "AKIA6LBEGXBLJCQP2OJK"
    secret_key = "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"
}

resource "aws_instance" "tfvm" {
    ami             = "ami-0ed9277fb7eb570c9"
    instance_type   = "t2.micro"
    key_name        = "terraform"
    vpc_security_group_ids = ["sg-01575d26e0db06683"]
    subnet_id              = "subnet-0c410364d74e34bd9"



    tags = {
        Name = "HelloWorld"
    }
}

output "private_ip" {
    value = aws_instance.tfvm.private_ip
}

output "public_ip" {
    value = aws_instance.tfvm.public_ip
}

So the different options available are listed in
https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/ec2-instance/aws/latest
